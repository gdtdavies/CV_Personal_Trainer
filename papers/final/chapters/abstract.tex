    The following report deals with the development of a computer vision-based training coach for which the goal was to assist a person in physical training through real-time feedback and pose estimation. The system, developed on the Mediapipe framework from Google, provides very high-accuracy detection of human poses and rich feedback regarding form during exercise to improve performance while minimising chances of injury. This has a full-fledged GUI at the front-end and a back-end database that will store user data and history of their workouts, and a mood-tracking feature to study the psychological impact of exercises.
    In controlled settings, accuracy was high; however, poor lighting created problems. Users also felt the GUI was easy to operate and visual feedback is helpful, although it needs better instructions and the text must be clearer. Unlike wearable fitness trackers, more informative feedback regarding form can be provided by the computer vision-based system, an addition to quite a bit of the available current technologies in fitness.
    Future work includes addition of more types of exercises, more advanced machine learning models, and making the system robust. The project has practical implications for both computer vision and physical training, providing a foundation for further research and development in these fields.\\
